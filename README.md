# Copy Hyperlink

## Description
An extension for the Chrome browser that allows you to copy the source URL along with the selected text.

## Installing
To install the browser extension, download the project as a .zip file, and extract. In Chrome, go to *Extensions* > *Manage Extensions* (or go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)). Click *"Load unpacked"* (top left), then select the project folder. Now you should be able to use the extension.

## How to Use
When no text is selected, clicking the extension icon - or selecting *"Copy with hyperlink"* after right-clicking - will copy the webpage title or heading (see below, under Options) as a hyperlink to the webpage to the clipboard.
When text is selected, the selected text is copied, along with the title/heading as hyperlink.

## Options
By default, the extension uses the h1 heading when available. When no h1 element can be found, or when you turn off the "use heading" options, it uses the page title.
You can also choose to include the current date.

## Examples
Depending on the options chosen, this is what the pasted selection will look like:
